## GEAR Hub – School Collaboration Platform

GEAR Hub is a unified digital environment built for students, teachers, and administrators to manage academic communication, classroom resources, and school-wide coordination. The platform begins with three separate login paths—Admin, Teacher, and Student—each leading to a dashboard designed specifically for that role. The system supports productivity tools such as a Pomodoro timer, a notes-and-quiz learning system, personal student timetables, class timetables, teacher schedules, and an events calendar covering all school deadlines and activities.

Students can read notes uploaded by teachers, create their own simplified summaries, and share them with classmates to improve collective understanding. As the academic year progresses, uploaded notes can be converted into quizzes or games that support revision and allow teachers to see how well topics are understood. Students also get a personal timetable they can customise, access to school and class schedules, and the ability to organise study materials, track their preparation time, and view their marks and feedback. Their communication space includes groups for their section, their grade, and their school house. House captains act as group admins, and only their messages notify the entire house.

Teachers have tools for uploading notes, tagging resources, creating quizzes, assigning homework, reviewing submissions, and analysing student performance. They can view class-level patterns such as commonly misunderstood topics or heavily accessed notes, and publish announcements or deadlines for their classes. Teachers are connected through three communication groups: one for teachers of the same grade, one for teachers of the same subject, and one shared by the entire teaching staff, enabling smooth coordination of lessons and schedules.

Admins, such as Smita Verma and Samita Chakraborty, manage every part of the platform. They create and update user accounts, assign roles, upload class timetables and teacher schedules, moderate student summaries, review channel activity, and configure settings such as branding, feature availability, and file-upload limits. They can also bulk-upload class rosters and marks, export homework and attendance data, monitor platform analytics, and maintain security through audit logs and permission controls. Admins see the full system, teachers see only their classes, and students see only their study-related tools.

Communication across the platform happens through channels that support mentions for students, teachers, and admins. Messages can be quickly pinned by hovering over them, and all posts follow strict role-based permissions. Students, teachers, and admins can each access only what they are meant to access, ensuring a clear separation of responsibilities.

For competition purposes, GEAR Hub also includes a demonstration mode where judges can add their own sample data and experience how the system functions with real entries. Preconfigured sample accounts are included for administrators, teachers (Roohani, Sujata, Rashmi, Nandini), and students (Arjun P Pai, Nayam K Desai, Sayaan Biswal, and Rudra Rathore).
