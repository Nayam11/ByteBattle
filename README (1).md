GEAR HUB
A smart, modular toolkit designed to simplify student life by unifying academics, communication, and growth into one seamless platform.  


 Inspiration  
Students often juggle multiple apps, reminders, and scattered resources. EdukIt was inspired by the idea of a **single toolkit** that could unify classes, assignments, grades, and collaboration into one place.  



 What it does  
- Tracks classes, assignments, and grades in a clean dashboard  
- Sends reminders for deadlines and exams  
- Enables collaboration with peers and teachers  
- Provides insights into personal progress  
- Works seamlessly on both mobile and web  



How we built it  
- **Frontend:** HTML + CSS for a responsive, dark‑themed UI  
- **Logic:** JavaScript for dynamic interactions and profile management  
- **Storage:** LocalStorage to persist student data across sessions  



 Challenges we ran into  
- Balancing simplicity with functionality in the UI  
- Debugging data persistence and ensuring smooth transitions between profile view and edit mode  
- Handling edge cases like empty fields or missing data  



 Accomplishments we’re proud of  
- Built a working prototype that feels intuitive and student‑friendly  
- Designed a modular layout that can easily be expanded  
- Achieved a responsive design that works across devices  


 What we learned  
- The importance of **user‑centered design** in education tools  
- How modular coding and clean UI/UX design improve scalability  
- How AI can accelerate debugging and refinement  


What’s next for EdukIt  
- Avatar uploads and theme customization  
- Calendar and productivity app integration  
- Expansion into a full student ecosystem with gamified learning and smart analytics
